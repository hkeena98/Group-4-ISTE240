                    <p>
                        Linux has a wide multitude of multimedia applications, from video, music, to pictures, 
                        Linux makes it easy to have fun and enjoy all of your digital entertainment.

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                    <p>
                        Linux has support for many online, and offline video games through the use of gaming 
                        software such as Steam, and PlayOnLinux. While many titles do not have a native port 
                        on Linux, emulators such as Wine allow users to play most video games directly on Linux systems.

                <h2>Customization</h2>
                    <p>
                        Linux is extremely customizable. Designed to give users complete control over their own system, 
                        as well as being open source in nature, allows users to change everything from minor applications 
                        to their entire desktop environment with as little effort as possible. Because the code to Linux 
                        and many of its distributions are available in an open source format, programmers both professional 
                        and hobbyist have been able to create multitudes of different applications capable of doing many of 
                        the same operations. This abundance of customization options has made personalization very easy and 
                        very simple.
